# PN532 driver for ESPIDF

This component adds support for PN532 peripherals in ESPIDF environments. The core implementation is based on [Adafruit's library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532), and the ESPIDF/FreeRTOS bits are taken from [a library released by Luca Faccin](https://github.com/lucafaccin/esp-pn532), but it was majorly overhauled and turned into a C++ implementation.
